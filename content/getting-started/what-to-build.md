All sorts of cool things. Truth be told, we're most looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
Here are a few common themes and thought starters:

- **POS Integration:** Our [APIs](/pos-integration/) provide a great easy way for POS providers to
integrate LevelUp into their merchant offering.

- **Online-Ordering/Checkout Integration:** Use the [LevelUp API](/api-reference/) to create a
seamless secure checkout flow for your online ordering or e-commerce site.

- **Recommendation Engine:** Mash-up LevelUp's transactional data about users' behavior with your own
to provide tailored recommendations about what places to visit.

- **Rewards & Redemption:** Reward your app's users with credits at merchants that can be seamlessly
redeemed by paying with LevelUp. Maybe when they hit a fitness goal in your running application, for
example.

- **Mobile Payment & Campaign Integration:** Use LevelUp's [SDK](/mobile-sdks/) to add a fully
functional mobile payment experience right within your app.

- **Transactional Validation:** Tap into LevelUp to validate if your users have actually transacted
at a certain place or bought a certain product, perhaps for verifying reviews.

- **Tons More:** There are ways to integrate LevelUp that we haven't even considered yet. That's why
we're opening up the platform. So tell us what awesome things you've got in mind, or just build them
and show us!
