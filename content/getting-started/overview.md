The LevelUp Developer Platform provides developers with the tools, functionality, and data to build
apps on LevelUp. Apps on LevelUp are able to interact with the entities (merchants, users) and data
(payments, transaction history, item level order detail) in the LevelUp ecosystem in new and
creative ways. The core concept of the LevelUp ecosystem is that of permissions. Apps on LevelUp
request permissions from users and/or merchants to be able to take certain actions, like charging
money, granting credit or reading transaction history.

LevelUp is the largest mobile payment network in the United States. We also aim to be the most open:

- Our [Permission Layer](/getting-started/permissions-list/) enables you to ask users and merchants for rich and granular permissions.
- Our [APIs](/api-reference/) give access to rich data about transactions, business locations, and
offers.
- Our [SDK](/mobile-sdks/) enables developers to enable their apps for mobile payment and leverage
our POS integrations.
- Our [POS Tools](/pos-integration/) make integrating LevelUp into a point-of-sale straightforward.
- Our [Mobile and E-Commerce Tools](/online-ordering/) make adding LevelUp to your e-commerce implementation
straightforward.

We’re continuously improving the platform, adding more functionality and making it easier for you to
use. We’re still new at this, so we appreciate your patience and we’re excited to see what you
build.
