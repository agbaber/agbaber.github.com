One of the core beliefs of LevelUp is the idea of **Interchange Zero**. In brief, Interchange Zero
is the theory that the cost of moving money will eventually trend to zero.

Our entire business model is based on this theory. We don't make money when processing payments. We
do that at cost, currently 2% flat, and as our cost drops, yours will too.

We make money when merchants, advertisers, or developers run "campaigns" on LevelUp. Campaigns are
built to motivate consumer behavior and drive value. For example, we can motivate new customers to
try out a business or bring in customers on a rainy day. LevelUp charges a 25% fee on any credit
delivered, and successfully redeemed, through campaigns run on LevelUp.

##Rule #1: When Processing Payments Using LevelUp, Charge LevelUp's Rate

If you are using LevelUp to process payments, and passing that cost on to someone else, you must
transparently charge them LevelUp's current rate. Right now that's 2%.

You can, of course, add your own fees on top of that for value-added services, but those must be
transparently broken out. We're doing our best to drive the cost of moving money to zero... so you
should focus on building applications that add value beyond the payment and if you want to charge,
charge for that.

##Rule #2: Only Ask For The Permissions You Need

LevelUp is a powerful platform that lets you do a lot on behalf of merchants and consumers. Ask for
the minimum permissions that you can rather than asking for everything and seeing what comes in
handy. Users are more likely to complete authentication if your app only asks for a narrow set of
permissions, and if they understand why your app needs them. You can always request additional
permissions later on.

##Rule #3: Be Respectful Of Users, Merchants & The LevelUp Ecosystem

When taking actions on behalf of users or merchants, make sure you have the appropriate permissions
and make sure to always communicate clearly what you're doing. If you discover a bug or security
flaw within our platform, please [let us know](mailto:support@thelevelup.com) right away. The best
apps find a clever way to add value beyond the payment to some part of the LevelUp Ecosystem.
