The LevelUp Integration SDK lets developers create merchant-oriented applications and components
that accept LevelUp payment. The SDK is currently available in limited preview for Windows with .NET
3.0. If you'd like access, [sign up](/getting-started/sign-up/).

## Usage
Once you've been given access, read our Getting Started guide for [C# & .NET]
(/pos-integration/integration-sdks/c-sharp/) to get set up.

A typical app will guide a merchant-user through [authenticating]
(/api-reference/v14/access-tokens-create/) with LevelUp before configuring the merchant's
store [location](/api-reference/v14/locations-list-by-merchant). After the merchant location is
configured, the SDK may be used to place [orders](/api-reference/v14/orders-create/), request
[refunds](/api-reference/v14/orders-refunds/), and obtain [order details]
(/api-reference/v14/orders-merchant-details/).

## Legal
Use of the SDK is bound by our 
<a href="https://www.thelevelup.com/developer-terms/" target="_blank">Developer Terms &
Conditions</a>. We also provide Rules of the Road for our [platform]
(/getting-started/rules-of-the-road/) and [SDK]
(/pos-integration/integration-sdks/rules-of-the-road/) to help you build great experiences using
LevelUp.
