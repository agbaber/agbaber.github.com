Below is an overview of the transaction process from a consumer perspective for a counter-service business:

<ol style="margin-top:50px;">
<li>The user will have the LevelUp app (or an app powered by LevelUp) on their phone.</li>
<li>They open that app to display their QR Code. The user may set a tip amount, which gets embedded into the QR Code.</li>
<li>They scan that QR Code at the LevelUp Scanner connected to the point-of-sale system.</li>
<li>The POS system processes the transaction.</li>
<li>Moments later, the consumer receives a push notification and email receipt detailing their purchase and any savings.</li>
<li>The customer, satisfied, collects their purchase and heads on their way.</li>
</ol>

At a full-service restaurant, LevelUp provides mobile hand-held scanners that can be used by the waiter to scan the consumer's phone right at the table.

LevelUp prides itself on enabling a simple, quick, and convenient user experience. As you can see in the flow above, the consumer never has to do anything but scan their phone to complete a payment. All discounts, rewards, loyalty progress etc. are applied automatically by LevelUp server-side. Again, the consumer never has to take any action (but pay) to trigger these actions.
