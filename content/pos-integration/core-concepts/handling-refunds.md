Refunding orders paid with LevelUp is straightforward. Simply take the order UUID (returned in the successful [order response](/api-reference/v14/orders-create/) object) and hit the [refunds endpoint](/api-reference/v14/orders-refunds/) on the LevelUp API.

LevelUp always refunds the full amount charged to the consumer, including taxes, tip, and credit. LevelUp does not support partial refunds or transactions for negative amounts.
