#### Obtaining an API key

Before beginning development on an e-commerce integration, you must obtain a unique API Key from LevelUp. This will uniquely identify you or your organization as a developer with LevelUp and should be kept private. You can obtain a API Key by filling out the [LevelUp API Key Request Form](/getting-started/sign-up/).
