The LevelUp Mobile SDK lets developers enable their consumer-oriented apps for mobile payment. The
SDK is currently available in limited preview for iOS and Android. If you'd like access, [sign
up](../getting-started/sign-up/).

## Usage

Once you've been given access, read our Getting Started guides for [iOS](getting-started/ios/) and
[Android](getting-started/android/) for setup instructions.

A typical app will guide a user through [logging in](core-concepts/login/) or [registering]
(core-concepts/register) with LevelUp. The app can then render a [payment token]
(core-concepts/payment) as a QR code, adding a [credit card](core-concepts/manage-cards/) if
necessary. The SDK also gives access to data about [locations](additional-concepts/locations/) that
the user can pay at, as well as details for that user's [order history]
(additional-concepts/order-history/) and merchant-specific [loyalty history and credit]
(additional-concepts/loyalty/).

## Legal

Use of the SDK is bound by our [Developer Terms & Conditions]
(https://www.thelevelup.com/developer-terms). We also provide Rules of the Road for our [platform]
(../getting-started/rules-of-the-road/) and [SDK](getting-started/rules-of-the-road/) to help you
build great experiences using LevelUp.
